Initial Description:
    This web app will help users determine the quality of a specific video game by showing a diverse set of reviews, pictures, prices, and any other relevant information. Every game will be assigned to a game title, genre, price and developer which are all under the same collection. The user will be required to assign an email address to their account if they wish to view or create any reviews on the website.
    As for what the client will see on the website, they will be given a choice of games, which when selected will present a page with reviews, the genre, the company that developed the game, and the current price of the game. The reviews are separated into two sections, Official and User. Since most game reviewers receive early versions of games and release their reviews before the game is released, the official reviews are going to be added by the developers (us) and adding official reviews will not be possible on the client side. For user reviews, they will be asked to give a rating 1-10 followed by a typed out review of their experience with the game. 

While this is how the project was intended to be made however due to time constraints and errors it did not appear to turn out that way. While it is still a "game review" website, we weren't able to add all of the intended user profiles, authentication, and overall user interactivity with the website. We also intended to use an API for the games tab but we chose to focus more on the requirements.
